# Graph-Machine-Learning-SBU-4012-final-project
## Introduction
At this project our task was to implement a GNN model in order to accurately predict molecular properties.<br>
For classification we use HIV dataset for classification and ESOL dataset for regression.<br>
these datasets can be found in [here](https://github.com/hhaji/funqg).<br>
This project implementation is provided by using DGL library and some tools from torch modules.<br>
At this project weâ€™ll compare effectiveness of different GNN models to predict task of datasets.<br>
## About Dataset
for classification I used HIV dataset and for regression I used ESOL dataset which their details are below<br>

this will be updated soon
